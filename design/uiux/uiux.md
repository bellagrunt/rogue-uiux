# What is user interface?

1. Key components:
- user + content = interface
- everyone (medium is the message) everything
2.  the medium effects the message, can change the message
- that medium is the interface
3. the interface shapes the experience


# The relationship between UI and UX

1. UI:
- how it looks (interface) visual design
- digital content 
- form aesthetics - look and feel - organization
- surface, visual identity (design driven)

2. UX: 
- how it feels (experience) non-visual design
- feel, navigation, story, structure
- content, engagement (user driven)

3. UI / UX:
- UI: visual design (tangible), design driven
- UX: Experience design (propositional), audience driven

- form design driven first


# Roles in UI/UX

- front end (interface design)

    ideation - ideas
    testing - feedback

- back end (programming)


# Interface Conventions: theory

- the blank screen is not a blank slate...

1. real world knowledge
- analog models
- you recognize digital buttons because you've experiencd analog buttons

2. learned behavior (conventions)
- press a button because you know how digital buttons work (even though they are flat)

3. cause and effect (action/reaction)
- press a button and something happens (often somewhere else)

4. logic/familiarity/consistency
- press another button and you know what will happen (it acts like the other buttons)

5. fast/seemless
- (speed and ease)
- no unnecessary steps (press the button and get it now!)

6. immediate intuition
- a few interactions teach a lot 

7. payoff/results/fulfillment
- if I take the time to press the button, I expect something in return 

8. undo/redo/confirm
- feel safe 
- if I press this button, nothing bad will happen. 
- will it?


# Interface Conventions: Application
- human interaction
- human touch to design and size of human elements to design 
- human touch with mobile makes it easy for humans to navigate around the app
    - finger - buttons
    - how we hold a ipad or phone, look / feel

- Phyiscal conventions - measure to human bodies
- digital concentions 


# Template vs content

1. Template
- Conventions
- predictable
- doesn't take content into account
- fast / easy
- flexible
- very clear
- not a lot of interaction
- structured

2. Content
- different grid
- creating something with more visual interest
- different color code system
- more rich with more experience
- ease of use
- one size does not fit all
- context specific design
    - has a relationship to specific content
    - certain user group
    - functionality 


# Aesthetics and Functionality

1. Aesthetics
- How it looks
- 

2. Functionality
- How it works

Aesthetics and Functionality = interface
- aesthetically, individual, interface, familiar, functionality
-
